What went well?
  Most of the code was converted from Kotlin to Java and everything is almost working in Java, which makes it much easier 
  to move forward. Nearing a releasable version 1 of the app as a whole.
What didn't go well?
  Final touches of Google Sheets implementation are taking far too much time. Google Maps API has unclear documentation = 
  much frustration and bugs. Need to improve documentation (JavaDoc form).
What have we learned?
  In order to get through a coding task in Android development, you really need to jump into it and not jump around place to 
  place.
What should we do differently next time?
  Stick to what you know and pick tasks to dive fully into.
What have we yet to figure out?
  Where to start with Eng/Span toggle. KML files. How Google Sheets/JSON will finally be implemented.
