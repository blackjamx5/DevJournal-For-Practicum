Sprint stuff:
  We wanted to lay down a skeleton of the three basic pages that divide the content they needed in place and we accomplished that -
  map was visible and buttons were in place on nutrition and exercise pages.
  
Spring goals:
  Need to get the map up to shape - all tags and easy navigation and user location.
  Need easy to use filters on content.
Priorities:
  Have remained constant.
Hopes and fears:
  Before I was hopeful about intuitiveness of Android Development and fearing not having time to work on it.
  The two have flipped.
