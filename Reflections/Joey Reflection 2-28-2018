Agile/Scrum in our project: 
Agile aims to have versions of a project completed on a regular basis as opposed to completing a project one step at the time so as to allow for continuous objective development. Scrum is a template for team operations involving regular, brief meetings for all around updates as well as some specific positions. The agile format has honestly been very difficult for our project. I think that's because we're learning app development as we go along. So it's taking us a long time to come up with any sort of solid version for the app because we have to stop and learn at every corner. But once we have a solid, complete, early version I feel like it will be easy to adopt the Agile workflow. The scrum system has been working very well for our team relationships and communication.
Community partner:
I think the communication with the community partner has been great. They've provided supplemental info and content when necessary and in our most recent meeting we went over the goals again and discussed UI and definitely felt on the same page coming out.
Hope/fear progression:
They've remained largely the same. Hopeful with a clear vision, fearing the difficulties of designing in Android Studio.
