This past sprint, we tried to get the skeletons for each activity up and running, and get the map
implemented. We actually got quite a lot of this done, although we ran into snags getting the map working fully.

This coming sprint, we will fully flush out the map, and get some other features implemented such as connecting google sheets data
to the app. We decided on these priorities based on what was communicated from Prof. Raney's team.

Our estimates were very accurate. I have felt like we have been on the same page this whole time.

My hopes and fears are still the same. I am optimistic but worried about the map, as it is very confusing.
